          <h3>Chalmers university of technology - B.S</h3>
          My bachelors degree was a major in Computer engineering and the education mixed both software and hardware.
          The parts I found interesting was the software, as this was new to me.
          I continued by selecting courses which were more software specific and gave me the ability to, after a masters degree, recieve the swedish title of "Civil Ingenjör".

      <h3>Here is a list of my Projects</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Needy</h4>
          Needy was the first real android project I build.
          It was a part of a university course where we were suppose to build an andrioid application for truck drivers.
          The functionality was very basic, it had a starting screen with four options, were a truck driver could select either: Food, Reststop, Gasstation or settings.
          I was in charge of mining JSON data from different official and no-nofficial (reverse engineering websites) to get the information about near reststops and gasstations.
          We also used the Google maps API to get near restaurants and to get directions to the nearest.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Pling</h4>
          The pling project was another university project where a few classmates and I build a simple order system for a local bike delivery company.
          The system included a website to create orders and an android application for the bikers to get directions and todays orders.
          I was in charge of the backend, this was done without any external librarys, in PHP. I managed the website and database with another person in charge of the front-end look.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>A tour wit Google glass</h4>
          This was my bachelor thesis, me and my partner created a google glass application to guide weares around a office and present information by scanning QR codes generated from the web service we also created.
          The web service was written in .NET and it was my first (and only) experience with C#.
          The publication can be found <a href="http://studentarbeten.chalmers.se/publication/220110-en-rundtur-med-google-glass">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Sigma programming Challenge</h4>
          This was my first industrial project, co-created with the consultingfirm Sigma. They needed a system to test the technical aspects of developers by asking technical questions and asking them to write code.
          I proposed the alternative of having an online compiler to do small task and check questions. The application supported compilation of C, C#, Java, Python code through HTPP post requests and managed questions and resutls in an Mongo Database.
          The webserver was written in NodeJS.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>iOS projects</h4>
          To extend my iOS knowledge and learn Swift, I created some very basic applications for iOS.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h6><a href="https://github.com/marcusthorstrom/Velocity">Velocity</a></h6>
              An application for measuring speed in diferent units (km/h, mph, knots, m/s).
            </li>
            <li>
              <h6>BRFKalkylatorn</h6>
              Application for calculating key values from housing cooperatives.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4><a href="https://github.com/marcusthorstrom/HemnetRaknaren">Hemnet räknaren</a></h4>
          This is a google chrome extension i created to be used with the swedish housing site Hemnet.
          This application calclulated the actual monthly cost of a house or apartment depending on certain parameters (rent, mortage etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4><a href="https://github.com/marcusthorstrom/LightControl">Light Control</a></h4>
          This is my simple "home automation" system used for turning on and off the lights in my apartment. The system uses a 433MHz sender to power on and off different ligths.
