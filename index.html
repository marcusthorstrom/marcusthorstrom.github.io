              I'm currently doing my master thesis at Volvo Cars and Ericsson, where I used Machine Learning to predict KPIs that are used to monitor the software delvelopment process.
              As machine learning is a new topic to me, this is very intresting and the results can be quite useful. The report will be (hopefully) published in June when the thesis is finnished.

              I'm currently in the process of finding a job, I don't have a company or business of preference, I'm looking for something interesting and challenging work.

                  My masters degree is in Software Engineering, a master aimed to investigate the process of creating software.

                  My bachelors degree was a major in Computer engineering and the education mixed both software and hardware.
                  The parts I found interesting was the software, as this was new to me.
                  I continued by selecting courses which were more software specific and gave me the ability to, after a masters degree, received the Swedish title of "Civil Ingenjör".

                  I started a company together with a class mate to be able to design websites on our spare time.
                  This far we have completed one site, <a href="http://enerma.se">Enerma.se</a>, which is a wordpress site.
                  I did most of the technical php and wordpress related stuff and my classmate did the css and graphical stuff.

                  During the summer of 2014 I worked as an intern at Qalixa Solutions developing their iOS application.
                  I learned to work with a team and use common techniques such as git and scrum. I also learned Objective-C, the (then current) language for iOS.

                  This is a google chrome extension i created to be used with the Swedish housing site Hemnet.

                  This was my first industrial project, co-created with the consulting firm Sigma. They needed a system to test the technical aspects of developers by asking technical questions and asking them to write code.
                  I proposed the alternative of having an online compiler to do small task and check questions. The application supported compilation of C, C#, Java, Python code through HTTP post requests and managed questions and results in a Mongo Database.
                  The back-end was written in NodeJS and the front-end used AngularJS 1.6.

                  This was my bachelor thesis, me and my partner created a google glass application to guide users around an office and present information by scanning QR codes generated from the web service we also created.
                  The web service was written in .NET and it was my first (and only) experience with C#.

                  The pling project was another university project where a few classmates and I build a simple order system for a local bike delivery company.
                  The system included a website to create orders and an android application for the bikers to get directions and todays orders.
                  I was in charge of the backend, this was done without any external libraries, in PHP. I managed the website and database with another person in charge of the front-end look.

                  Needy was the first real android project I build.
                  It was a part of a university course where we were suppose to build an android application for truck drivers.
                  The functionality was very basic, it had a starting screen with four options, were a truck driver could select either: Food, Reststop, Gasstation or settings.
                  I was in charge of mining JSON data from different official and non-official (reverse engineering websites) APIs to get the information about near rest-stops and gas stations.
                  We also used the Google maps API to get near restaurants and to get directions to the nearest.
